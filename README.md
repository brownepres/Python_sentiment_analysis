**This is a personal project by Barnab√°s Epres to showcase the differences between the two sentiment analyser language models, VADER and roBERTa, and display several inferential statistic values. **

For the dataset I have utilized a compilation of amazon reviews containing the text reviews and the given scores to the products by multiple users. More info about the dataset and its source can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

The aim of this project was to demonstrate how the two models differentiate from each other. VADER model uses a method to determine the sentiment for each word in a sentence, then calculates the weighted average value to make an overall compound score for the input text's sentiment. The roBERTa model works on similar basis, however it takes the context and surrounding words into account, therefore it gives a smoother approach to sentences. My goal was to demostrate this difference, especially while analysing edge-cases (e.g.: sarcasm, irony), and to show that VADER model misunderstands such situations, while roBERTa recognises them in most cases. 

Difficulties: the VADER model calculates positive, negative and neutral sentiment value alongside with a combined so-called compound value, on a scale from -1 to 1, -1 being negative sentiment. On the other hand roBERTa model operates with only the three sentiment values (pos, neu, neg), all of them calulated on a scale from 0 to 1, 0 being negative sentiment. To overcome the challenges caused by the used measurements, I normalized the three output values of the roBERTa model and applied a hyperbolic tangent function on them to calculate roBERTa compound. With this modification, both models had a compound value measured on the same scale, from -1 to 1. The idea of the hyperbolic tangent function came from Linda Erwe's and Xin Wang's [paper](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9145112) on the matter.

Conclusion: I have decided to select the 30 most controversial sentences in my sample to simulate the edge cases and determine which model has the bigger correlation between the review's text's sentiment and the given score. By controversial sentences I mean the texts where the VADER compound and roBERTa compound values are the furthest from eachother. In the selected cases, roBERTa compound values have a strong, 0.54 correlation while VADER compounds have a surprisingly large, negativ correlation (-0.46). As it is shown on the plot, the two compound values are on the opposite side of the y axis, but the gives scores tend to be closer to the roBERTa compound values. 

Statistics: for my own entertrainment I have made a tiny statistical side quest and calculated the 95% confidence interval of VADER compound, roBERTa compound and score value for the entire dataset. Results were respectively [0.586, 0.645], [0.384, 0.447], [4.08, 4.24].
